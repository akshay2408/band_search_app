# Project Name - Band Search App

The Band Search App is a full-stack web application built using Ruby on Rails as the backend and React.js as the frontend. It allows users to search for music bands based on their city, listing bands that were founded in the past 10 years. The app also tries to detect the userâ€™s location automatically and show results based on their city.
